-- ============================================================
-- URGENT: RUN THIS IMMEDIATELY TO FIX EVERYTHING
-- ============================================================
-- This will:
-- 1. Create urgent_requirements table
-- 2. Enable RLS with proper policies
-- 3. Add all 10 fallback requirements to database
-- 4. Make hide/show work properly
-- ============================================================

-- STEP 1: Create the table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS urgent_requirements (
    id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    title           TEXT NOT NULL,
    slug            TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    country         TEXT NOT NULL,
    country_code    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'XX',
    category        TEXT NOT NULL,
    vacancies       INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    salary          TEXT NOT NULL,
    experience_required TEXT,
    image_url       TEXT,
    summary         TEXT,
    content         TEXT NOT NULL,
    status          TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'closed', 'expired')),
    expires_at      TIMESTAMPTZ,
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- STEP 2: Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_urgent_requirements_status ON urgent_requirements(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_urgent_requirements_country ON urgent_requirements(country);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_urgent_requirements_expires_at ON urgent_requirements(expires_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_urgent_requirements_slug ON urgent_requirements(slug);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_urgent_requirements_created_at ON urgent_requirements(created_at DESC);

-- STEP 3: Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE urgent_requirements ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- STEP 4: Drop old policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view active urgent requirements" ON urgent_requirements;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage urgent requirements" ON urgent_requirements;

-- STEP 5: Create RLS policies
-- Policy 1: Public users see only active, non-expired items
CREATE POLICY "Public can view active urgent requirements"
ON urgent_requirements
FOR SELECT
TO anon, authenticated
USING (
    status = 'active' 
    AND (expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > NOW())
);

-- Policy 2: Authenticated users have full access
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can manage urgent requirements"
ON urgent_requirements
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- STEP 6: Create update trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_urgent_requirements_updated_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_urgent_requirements_updated_at ON urgent_requirements;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_urgent_requirements_updated_at
BEFORE UPDATE ON urgent_requirements
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_urgent_requirements_updated_at();

-- STEP 7: Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT ON urgent_requirements TO anon;
GRANT ALL ON urgent_requirements TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON urgent_requirements TO service_role;

-- STEP 8: Insert all 10 default urgent requirements
-- This populates the database with initial data
